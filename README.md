# TLDR
Recently, I've been really upset with the current state of social media. All I want to do is post about my life and share stuff like that with my friends, but the fact that the apps themselves are designed in such a hostile way makes regularly doing that much more difficult than it should be. Infinite Scrolling... Shortform Content... a Bajillion Gajillion Ads... you get it. None of it feels good to use!!! even though beneath it I really like to connect with cool people on the web-

Therefore, this is a project that'll allow me to post regularly about my life online and share it with my friends. I'll probably end up still using conventional social media, but I dont want to feel pressured to post about my personal life there a ton anymore. I know in my heart that I'll always have a way to see all the cool stuff my friends do, and I hope this makes it easy to see what cool stuff I'm up to aswell.
